              <h2>Who is he?</h2>
              <p>Isaac Newton, born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, England, was a renowned mathematician,
                physicist, and astronomer. His groundbreaking work laid the foundation for classical mechanics and the
                laws of motion. Newton's most celebrated publication, "Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica,"
                revolutionized our understanding of the physical world and remains a cornerstone of scientific thought.

              <h2>Before Isaac's Birth</h2>
              <p>
                Isaac Newton's father, also named Isaac Newton, died three months before Newton was born on January 4, 1643. The elder Newton was a prosperous farmer, but he passed away at the age of 36, leaving his widow, Hannah Ayscough Newton, to raise their son in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England.</p>

                <p>
                  Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England, according to the Julian calendar. However, when the Gregorian calendar was later adopted, his birthdate adjusted to January 15, 1643.</p>

                    Isaac Newton's mother, Hannah Ayscough Newton, remarried when Isaac was three years old. After her second marriage to Barnabas Smith, the family moved to nearby North Witham, leaving Isaac in the care of his maternal grandmother for a few years until his mother returned a widow after her second husband's death.</p>

                    <p> Newton attended Trinity College, Cambridge, and his early education was interrupted by the outbreak of the bubonic plague in 1665. During this time, known as the "Plague Year," the university was closed, and Newton returned to his hometown.
